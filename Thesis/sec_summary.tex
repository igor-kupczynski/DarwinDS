In the paper a novel approach to multi-objective optimisation was
presented. The DARWIN method is an interactive procedure utilising the
evolutionary algorithm to optimize population of solutions. The idea of DARWIN
was first proposed by Salvatore Greco, Benedetto Matarazzo and Roman Słowiński
in~[ref]. However this in this paper first implementation and numerical
results are provided.

The novelty of the method comes from utilizing an IMO process along with the
EMO procedure. DARWIN not only optimises the population of solutions but also
drives the optimization towards regions preferred by the decision maker. In
order to do it the preference information has to be aggregated. This is done
by asking the DM simple questions. A list of feasible solutions is given and
he or she is asked to indicate the ``good'' ones among them. The procedure
uses dominance-based rough set approach and the DomLem algorithm to obtain a
set of \textit{``it \dots, then \dots''} decision rules.
